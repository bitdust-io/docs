#Ecosystem

The BitDust network is a complex ecosystem. To make the BitDust network functioning there is a complex ecosystem.
This ecosystem consist out of different roles that either use or support the BitDust network. In this section 
we want to provide a short overview of the different roles that make up the BitDust ecosystem. You can click on the 
different roles and see more in-depth information and more importantly on how to become that particular role. 

The BitDust ecosystem consist out of either customers that use the BitDust network for encrypted storage and chat
or out of different supporting roles to make it possible for customers to use the BitDust network.
Currently we have 4 supporting roles that are active and 2 roles that are still being developed. Once all the 6 
supporting roles are live the full power of the BitDust network is unleashed. 

##Becoming a customer of the BitDust network
A customer/user of the BitDust network will have the possibility to install BitDust on their laptop/PC. Once installed
the user can create a identity anonymously and start enjoying the BitDust product. For now once a user has installed
BitDust they can use start using BitDust to be in full control of their data. Every piece of data that runs on the '
network is encrypted with your private key. Nobody else has access unless you provide access. For now we offer the 
following features:

* Anonymously creating a BitDust account
* Upload and download encrypted data
* Share data with trusted contacts
* Add friends/contact to share files with and chat
* Fully encrypted chat between friends/contacts

All of the above features can be accessed via a simple program that you can install on your laptop/PC. We have versions
for Mac, Windows, Linux and Rasberry Pi.

##Becoming a supporter in the BitDust network
To make the BitDust network function there are multiple roles needed to support the network. For now all of the roles
can only be created by using command line. This basically means that you don't have an easy to use interface to set-up
your supporting role, like you have when you use BitDust as a customer/user. We will be making this available in the
future so everybody can join. For now we focus on making it possible to set-up the entire BitDust ecosystem and afterwards
focus on usability so not only developers can fulfill a supporting role, but also grandma with her laptop:).

We currently have the following supporting roles which are live and you can set-up by using command line. They are descibed
in short below. Click on the role to get more detailled information and how to set this role up on your local machine.
