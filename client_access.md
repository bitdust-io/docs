1. Implement a secure WebSocket connection between BitDust Node (background engine process) and Mobile Client App
2. Update API interface and make possible to forward API traffic via secure WebSocket connection
3. Make possible to route API traffic from Mobile App to BitDust Node via API servers - helps to connect your Mobile App with your home PC/Laptop
4. Update Android App and replace currect solution (which runs foreground service) with secure API link via WebSocket connection
5. Build iPhone & iPad app and publish in the AppStore
6. Implement method for backup&restore BitDust identity on the remotely running BitDust Node directly via Mobile App
7. Add verification of the Mobile device when connecting to the BitDust node for the first time to prevent "man-in-the-middle" attack (like 2FA does)
8. Write extensive documentation and manuals about starting BitDust on the private server or VPS in the cloud
9. Add document about running BitDust on Raspberry PI at home
10. Make possible to run BitDust Node hosted as a Docker container - in docker swarm or docker hosting
11. Create centralized BitDust back-end and user dashboard to be able to accept payments from users
12. Make possible for a user to buy a server or docker image (hosted and maintained by BitDust B.V.) that runs a dedicated BitDust node for the user
