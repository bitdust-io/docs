Currently, personal information is becoming more valuable and significant in the rapidly developing digital world. Personal photos, files, data on relatives and children, etc. are currently stored separately in various centralized services and are often used without the permission of the data owner, sometimes even causing harm. The lack of secure storage is a problem for Internet users.

BitDust Technology solves this problem by providing users the ability to store their data fully encrypted on a decentralized network via an easy-to-use application. Providing them the ability to share data only with trusted contacts. In its core, BitDust is a distributed network for data storage and secure communications: each network participant provides a portion of their hard drive for other users. In exchange, they can store data on other peers. The redundancy in backup makes it so that if someone loses your data, you can rebuild what was lost and give it to someone else to hold. And all of this happens without you having to do a thing - the software keeps your data safe.





Finally you can take a full control of your personal data on the Internet and make sure you are not compromised and data is not sold out to the marketing companies.

BitDust is a distributed on-line storage network where only data owner has full access to the private data and power to share it to someone else.

All files uploaded via BitDust are stored in a small redundant pieces on other users machines around the world. To be able to download your data back you must posses the private key that was used to encrypt the data during uploading.

Another user holding pieces of your data can not identify or read it without your private key - which gives you complete anonymity and privacy of data storage. By design in BitDust no one is able to intercept your messages or files - even the developers of BitDust do not have access to your data.

BitDust team stands for private, safe and trully confidential on-line communications for everyone. We chose our mission in XI century - to build a software product that will enable people around the world to have full control of own digital life.
